    <h1>Welcome to my JAMstack website</h1>
    <h3>Its super easy</h3>

    <p>This website is built with HTML and deployed using GitHub. This website is created by me. 
      Web infrastructure connects multiple  components: client, server, database, CDN. 
CMS platforms simplify content management  but require backend setup. 
JAMStack and serverless hosting simplify  deployment for beginners. (newer / simpler)
 GitHub offers a practical entry into modern  web hosting. (storing/sharing code) </p>
